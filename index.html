    <h4>MY EXPERIENCE AND HABITS ABOUT PROGRAMMING</h4>
    <p>Curious and creative, I am always eager to learn new things. I have a natural attitude for coding and enjoy the challenge of solving problems. I am self-motivated and always look for new ways to improve my skills. I am passionate about technology and excited about the future of programming. I am also a role model for other children, inspiring them to learn about coding. Some of my accomplishments include creating a website for my school, developing a mobile app, and winning first place in a coding competition. I have also given a presentation at a local tech conference about my coding projects. I am confident that I will continue to achieve great things in the years to come. And I hope to win the race of programming with the whole world!</p>
