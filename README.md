    <h4>HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT WHAT PROGRAMMING REALLY IS?</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.</li><br>

        <li>Programming refers to the logical process of telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand.</li><br>

    <h4>MY EXPERIENCE AND HABITS ABOUT PROGRAMMING</h4>
    <p>Curious and creative, I am always eager to learn new things. I have a natural attitude for coding and enjoy the challenge of solving problems.
    I am self-motivated and always look for new ways to improve my skills. I am passionate about technology and excited about the future of programming.
    I am also a role model for other children, inspiring them to learn about coding.
    Some of my accomplishments include creating a website for my school, developing a mobile app, and winning first place in a coding competition.
    I have also given a presentation at a local tech conference about my coding projects.
    I am confident that I will continue to achieve great things in the years to come.
    And I hope to win the race of programming with the whole world!
